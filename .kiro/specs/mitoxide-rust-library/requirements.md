# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Mitoxide is a production-ready Rust library and agent system that reproduces key Mitogen concepts for remote execution and automation. The project implements a multi-crate Cargo workspace with SSH-based transport, binary RPC protocol, remote agent bootstrapping, and WASM payload execution capabilities. The system is designed with strict TDD methodology, comprehensive testing including Docker-based simulations, and fully automated CI/CD with semantic releases.
